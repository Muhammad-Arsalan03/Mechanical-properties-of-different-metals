# Mechanical-properties-of-different-metals
Calculated different mechanical properties of metals using python

This file reads the high carbon steel tension.csv, tension testing low carbon steel.csv, and tension testing aluminum.csv,
then we have to find the following properties;
1).stress.
2).strain
3). Stress strain curve.
4). Ultimate tensile strength.
5). Young's Modulus.
6). Yield strength.
7). Failure strength.
and also we have to find the torsional testing properties,
1).shear stress
2). shear strain
3). Modulus of rigidity.
4). Toughness
5). Shear stress and strain curve
6). Charpy impact test under high  room temperature
7). Charpy impact test under low room temperature
